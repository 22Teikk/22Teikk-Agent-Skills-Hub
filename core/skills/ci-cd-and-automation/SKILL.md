# CI/CD and Automation

## Overview

Automate quality gates so that no change reaches production without passing tests, lint, type checking, and build. CI/CD is the enforcement mechanism for every other skill — it catches what humans and agents miss, and it does so consistently on every single change.

**Shift Left:** Catch problems as early in the pipeline as possible. A bug caught in linting costs minutes; the same bug caught in production costs hours. Move checks upstream — static analysis before tests, tests before staging, staging before production.

**Faster is Safer:** Smaller batches and more frequent releases reduce risk, not increase it. A deployment with 3 changes is easier to debug than one with 30. Frequent releases build confidence in the release process itself.

## When to Use

- Setting up a new project's CI pipeline
- Adding or modifying automated checks
- Configuring deployment pipelines
- When a change should trigger automated verification
- Debugging CI failures

## The Quality Gate Pipeline

Every change goes through these gates before merge:

```
Pull Request Opened
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   LINT           │  linter/detekt
│   ↓ pass         │
│   STATIC ANALYSIS│  static check
│   ↓ pass         │
│   UNIT TESTS     │  unit test run
│   ↓ pass         │
│   BUILD          │  build/compile
│   ↓ pass         │
│   INTEGRATION    │  integration tests
│   ↓ pass         │

│   ↓ pass         │
│   SECURITY AUDIT │  dependency check
└─────────────────┘

  Ready for review
```

**No gate can be skipped.** If lint fails, fix lint — don't disable the rule. If a test fails, fix the code — don't skip the test.

## GitHub Actions Configuration

> **Templates are in references/ci-templates.md.** This skill owns the *decisions* (which gates, in what order, why each matters); the appendix owns the YAML copy-paste blocks (basic CI, integration tests, E2E, preview deploy, rollback, dependabot, caching+parallelism, feature-flag pattern). Read the appendix when actually wiring up a workflow — don't load ~150 lines of YAML into context just to skim them.

## Feeding CI Failures Back to Agents

The power of CI with AI agents is the feedback loop. When CI fails:

```
CI fails
    │
    ▼
Copy the failure output
    │
    ▼
Feed it to the agent:
"The CI pipeline failed with this error:
[paste specific error]
Fix the issue and verify locally before pushing again."
    │
    ▼
Agent fixes → pushes → CI runs again
```

**Key patterns:**

```
Lint failure → Agent runs `./gradlew lint` (or formatting tasks) and commits
Type error  → Agent reads the error location and fixes the type
Test failure → Agent follows debugging-and-error-recovery skill
Build error → Agent checks config and dependencies
```

### Preview Deployments

Every PR gets a preview build deployed to testing tracks (e.g. Firebase App Distribution) for QA verification. See references/ci-templates.md → "Preview Deployments" for the workflow YAML.

### Feature Flags

Feature flags decouple deployment from release. Deploy incomplete or risky features behind flags so you can:

- **Ship code without enabling it.** Merge to main early, enable when ready.
- **Roll back without redeploying.** Disable the flag remotely instead of releasing a new APK.
- **Canary new features.** Enable for 1% of users, then 10%, then 100%.

The Kotlin Remote Config pattern is in references/ci-templates.md → "Feature Flag Pattern" — load only when wiring the check into actual code.

**Flag lifecycle:** Create → Enable for testing → Canary → Full rollout → Remove the flag and dead code. Flags that live forever become technical debt — set a cleanup date when you create them.

### Staged Rollouts

```
PR merged to main
    │
    ▼
  Staging deployment (auto)
    │ Manual verification
    ▼
  Production deployment (manual trigger or auto after staging)
    │
    ▼
  Monitor for errors (15-minute window)
    │
    ├── Errors detected → Rollback
    └── Clean → Done
```

### Rollback Plan

Every deployment should be reversible. See references/ci-templates.md → "Rollback Workflow" for the manual-rollback dispatch YAML.

## Environment Management

```
.env.example       → Committed (template for developers)
.env                → NOT committed (local development)
.env.test           → Committed (test environment, no real secrets)
CI secrets          → Stored in GitHub Secrets / vault
Production secrets  → Stored in deployment platform / vault
```

CI should never have production secrets. Use separate secrets for CI testing.

## Automation Beyond CI

### Dependabot / Renovate

Schedule automated dependency PRs weekly; cap concurrent open PRs so review bandwidth stays sane. Full `.github/dependabot.yml` template is in references/ci-templates.md → "Dependabot / Renovate".

### Build Cop Role

Designate someone responsible for keeping CI green. When the build breaks, the Build Cop's job is to fix or revert — not the person whose change caused the break. This prevents broken builds from accumulating while everyone assumes someone else will fix it.

### PR Checks

- **Required reviews:** At least 1 approval before merge
- **Required status checks:** CI must pass before merge
- **Branch protection:** No force-pushes to main
- **Auto-merge:** If all checks pass and approved, merge automatically

## CI Optimization

When the pipeline exceeds 10 minutes, apply these strategies in order of impact:

```
Slow CI pipeline?
├── Cache dependencies
│   └── Use actions/cache or setup-java cache option for Gradle cache
├── Run jobs in parallel
│   └── Split lint, typecheck, test, build into separate parallel jobs
├── Only run what changed
│   └── Use path filters to skip unrelated jobs (e.g., skip e2e for docs-only PRs)
├── Use matrix builds
│   └── Shard test suites across multiple runners
├── Optimize the test suite
│   └── Remove slow tests from the critical path, run them on a schedule instead
└── Use larger runners
    └── GitHub-hosted larger runners or self-hosted for CPU-heavy builds
```

**Example: caching and parallelism** — see references/ci-templates.md → "Caching + Parallelism" for the full workflow with `lint` and `test` jobs split across runners and `setup-java` cache enabled.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "CI is too slow" | Optimize the pipeline (see `## CI Optimization` below), don't skip it. A 5-minute pipeline prevents hours of debugging. |
| "This change is trivial, skip CI" | Trivial changes break builds. CI is fast for trivial changes anyway. |
| "The test is flaky, just re-run" | Flaky tests mask real bugs and waste everyone's time. Fix the flakiness. |
| "We'll add CI later" | Projects without CI accumulate broken states. Set it up on day one. |
| "Manual testing is enough" | Manual testing doesn't scale and isn't repeatable. Automate what you can. |

## Red Flags

- No CI pipeline in the project
- CI failures ignored or silenced
- Tests disabled in CI to make the pipeline pass
- Production deploys without staging verification
- No rollback mechanism
- Secrets stored in code or CI config files (not secrets manager)
- Long CI times with no optimization effort

## Verification

After setting up or modifying CI:

- [ ] All quality gates are present (lint, types, tests, build, audit)
- [ ] Pipeline runs on every PR and push to main
- [ ] Failures block merge (branch protection configured)
- [ ] CI results feed back into the development loop
- [ ] Secrets are stored in the secrets manager, not in code
- [ ] Deployment has a rollback mechanism
- [ ] Pipeline runs in under 10 minutes for the test suite
